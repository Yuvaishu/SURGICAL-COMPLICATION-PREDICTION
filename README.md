# SURGICAL-COMPLICATION-PREDICTION
AI is developed to predict the possible surgical complications before the cataract surgery based on the patient's medical history.
The use of AI to predict complications during surgery is an emerging field in healthcare. 
By analysing vast amounts of data from electronic medical records, surgical videos, and patient information, AI models can learn to identify patterns and predict potential complications before they occur.
AI models can be used to predict a variety of surgical complications. These predictions can help surgeons prepare for potential complications and take preventive measures to minimise risk.
Overall, the use of AI to predict surgical complications has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by allowing surgeons to take preventive measures and avoid complications before they occur.
